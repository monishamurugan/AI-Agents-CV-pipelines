LLM-Powered AI Agents for Building and Validating Computer Vision Pipelines


Computer vision systems are more common in businesses like Retail, Healthcare,
Manufacturing, etc. These systems mainly depend on Deep Learning models for Object
Detection, Image Segmentation and Image Classification, etc. Running Deep Learning models
manually requires complex video processing and resource management, so the existing
solution uses GStreamer, a powerful multimedia pipeline framework that efficiently handles
video streams and model execution. The pipeline configuration requires many technical
details, and the existing solution uses complicated user interfaces (UI) to collect these
configuration inputs from technical experts. The central idea of this research is to simplify
this complex configuration process with conversational AI interface that can understand
human instructions written in English language, like "set up an occupancy agent at Store A
in X location," allowing the system to configure pipelines automatically. The proposed
system focuses on building LLM-powered autonomous agents and tools that simplify and
accelerate the process of building video processing pipelines. The system validates the
configuration and provides real-time feedback to users through the chat interface. Since LLM
is a rapidly growing field with continuous research breakthroughs, it's an ideal opportunity
to automate these manual and time-consuming setup processes.
